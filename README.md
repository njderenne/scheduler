# Scheduler

## Application Description

A mobile first approach to the creation of a daily schedule meant to used during working business hours to help users better keep track of events and overall productivity.

## How it Works

When the application is ran the user will be presented with a hour by hour format of business hours from 9 AM to 5 PM as well as the current date. If the user wants to add an event they simply click on the text area between the time and save button. To save the event click the save button on the right-hand side. This will hold for the user even with page refreshes. As the day progress the application will update displaying the past hours in gray, the present hour in red, and future hours in green.
